                and number 15 on the US Billboard
                chart. The album featured the international hits "Take On Me" and "The Sun Always Shines on T.V.,"
                earning a Grammy nomination for Best New Artist.

                Following successful releases in 1986, 1988, and 1990, a-ha went on hiatus in 1994 after the commercial

            <p>
                In the early stages, "Take On Me" by a-ha started as "Miss Eerie" when Morten Harket first heard
                Magne Furuholmen and Pål Waaktaar play in Asker. Originally known as Bridges, a-ha's first recorded
                version was named "Lesson One," later re-recorded and released as "Take On Me" in 1984. Despite initial
                setbacks, a re-release in 1985, accompanied by a groundbreaking video, propelled the song to number one
                on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the UK Singles Chart.

                The iconic video utilized rotoscoping and garnered a-ha six MTV Video Awards in 1986. Their second
                single, "The Sun Always Shines on T.V.," achieved success, and the band received a Grammy nomination for
                Best New Artist in 1986. While "Take On Me" remains their most recognized hit in the US, a-ha continued
                to enjoy success globally with their album "Hunting High and Low," which sold 11 million copies
                worldwide and earned platinum status in the US and the UK. Despite being considered a one-hit wonder in
                the US, a-ha's impact extended beyond "Take On Me," maintaining popularity in the UK throughout the
                1980s and early 1990s.

                During their 1986 world tour, a-ha released their second album, "Scoundrel
                Days," signaling a shift towards alternative rock. While well-received, the album's sales of 6.4 million
                copies did not match their debut's success, except in Switzerland. "Cry Wolf" became their last single
                to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, marking their last US appearance for two decades. The album,
                certified platinum in the UK, Switzerland, and Brazil, and gold in Germany, received positive reviews,
                with critic Ned Raggett praising its opening tracks.

                In 1988, a-ha released their third album, "Stay on These Roads," matching the chart success of its
                predecessors. The album, certified platinum in Brazil and France and gold in Switzerland, Germany, the
                UK, and the Netherlands, featured the title track, the theme song for the James Bond film "The Living
                Daylights." The band embarked on a 74-city world tour, and the album sold over 4.2 million copies
                worldwide.

                Their next release, "East of the Sun, West of the Moon," included a cover of The Everly Brothers'
                "Crying in the Rain." In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a-ha found popularity in South America,
                particularly in Brazil, where they achieved record-breaking concert attendance at Rock in Rio II in
                1991. Despite the lack of media attention, a-ha viewed the achievement as a devastating blow. The album
                was certified gold in Switzerland, Brazil, and Germany, and silver in the UK.

                The band's fourth album, "Memorial Beach," released in 1993, faced commercial disappointment, with only
                the single "Dark Is the Night" charting outside Norway. Despite this, Q magazine listed it among the
                best albums of 1993. Following the 1994 Winter Olympics concerts, a-ha entered an unofficial hiatus,
                with band members pursuing solo projects.

                In the midst of their 1986 world tour, a-ha released "Scoundrel Days," marking a shift toward
                alternative rock as synthpop declined in popularity. While the album received favorable reviews and
                produced three international hits, including "Cry Wolf," it sold 6.4 million copies, not matching the
                success of its predecessor, except in Switzerland. The band's next release, "Stay on These Roads"
                (1988), matched the chart success of its predecessors, certified platinum in Brazil and France. The
                title track became the theme song for the James Bond film "The Living Daylights." The band continued
                with albums like "East of the Sun, West of the Moon" (1990), "Memorial Beach" (1993), and a hiatus in
                1994.

                In 1998, a-ha performed at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert, marking their comeback, and then released
                "Minor Earth Major Sky" in 2000. The album reached platinum status, spawning hits like "Summer Moved
                On." The band continued with "Lifelines" (2002), a live album, and a singles collection in 2004.
                Celebrating their 20th anniversary, a-ha played Live 8 in Berlin in 2005 and released "Analogue" later
                that year. The album included a-ha's first top-ten hit in the UK since 1988, and the band received the Q
                Magazine Inspiration Award in London in 2006. In 2009, they won the Spellemann Award for "Take On Me,"
                marking its 25th anniversary and 50 years on Norway's hit list.

                In May 2008, a-ha's members held solo concerts in Oslo before reuniting for performances showcasing new
                songs and their album "Foot of the Mountain." Released in June 2009, the album marked a return to
                synth-pop and received acclaim, entering the German charts at number one and reaching number five in the
                UK. The band announced their disbandment after the 2010 Ending on a High Note Tour, which sold out
                rapidly. Despite disbanding, a-ha released compilations, deluxe editions, and a new single, "Butterfly,
                Butterfly." The band's farewell concerts in Oslo were recorded, resulting in the release of "Ending on a
                High Note Live" in various formats, including their first Blu-ray. Their final performance was
                commemorated with a DVD and CD box set, released in April 2011. a-ha played a special performance in
                2011 at Oslo Spektrum for a national memorial service dedicated to the victims of the 2011 Norway
                attacks.

                Following a-ha's breakup, Morten Harket released two solo albums, "Out of My Hands" (2012) and "Brother"
                (2014). Pål Waaktaar contributed to a new project, Weathervane, in collaboration with vocalist Jimmy
                Gnecco in June 2011, releasing a self-titled single included in the "Headhunters" movie soundtrack.
                Another song, "Manmade Lake," initially planned for "Foot of the Mountain," was released on Soundcloud
                in 2013. In 2012, Magne Furuholmen mentored on "The Voice – Norges beste stemme" and produced the debut
                album for his mentee, Martin Halla, who won the contest. In 2014, Furuholmen composed songs and
                supervised recordings for the Norwegian film "Beatles."

                In 2015, a-ha reunited for Rock in Rio and announced plans to re-release their first five albums on
                vinyl and deluxe editions for albums three through five. Their tenth studio album, "Cast in Steel," was
                released in September 2015, accompanied by a European tour from March to May 2016. They also performed
                at the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo. On May 3, 2016, a-ha collaborated with Void, a Norwegian
                computational design studio, for a concert at Oslo Spektrum featuring advanced scenography using 360
                virtual reality technology. The unique concert involved motion detectors, 3D cameras, and extensive
                coding, transforming the arena into a live visual experience for the audience.

                From 2017 to 2021, a-ha embarked on the MTV Unplugged and Hunting High and Low tours. In November 2017,
                they released an acoustic album and film, "Summer Solstice," featuring performances recorded on the
                Norwegian island of Giske. The album included two new songs, "This Is Our Home" and "A Break in the
                Clouds." The MTV Unplugged versions of iconic hits like "The Sun Always Shines on T.V," "The Living
                Daylights," and a re-imagined "Take On Me" garnered widespread acclaim.

                In early 2018, a-ha commenced a European acoustic tour initially named "An Acoustic Evening with a-ha"
                but later renamed "MTV Unplugged Tour 2018." The acoustic rendition of "Take On Me" was featured in the
                movie Deadpool 2 and an episode of The Magicians.

                Their Hunting High and Low tour, starting in October 2019 in Dublin, showcased their debut album in its
                entirety along with other songs. Unfortunately, the tour was postponed in 2020 due to the COVID-19
                pandemic, affecting planned concerts across multiple countries. The band introduced the new song
                "Digital River" during the tour.

                On June 13, 2021, the documentary "a-ha: The Movie" premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival, chronicling
                the band's journey, successes, and challenges over four years. The film, directed by Thomas Robsahm,
                explores personal conflicts among band members and was globally released.

                October 21, 2022, they released a new film and album titled True North. Recorded with the Norwegian
                Arctic Philharmonic Orchestra in Bodø, Norway, the film captures a live performance complemented by
                scenic clips from Norway's landscapes. The lead single, "I'm In," was released on July 8, 2022, and two
                of the album's songs, "Forest for the Trees" and "You Have What It Takes," were performed during the
                2022 tour. The album's second single, "You Have What It Takes," came out on September 16, 2022. In 2023,
                "Take On Me" ranked No. 26 on Billboard's list of the 500 Best Pop Songs of All Time, commemorating 65
                years of the Hot 100 chart.
